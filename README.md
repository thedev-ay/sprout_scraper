# Sprout Scraper

Sprout APIs for attendance time in and time out.

Implemented using Puppeteer and running on ExpressJS.

This is part 1 of the plan. The next part is the mobile application (will be made in [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/)) which calls these APIs.

## Usage

```bash
npm run start-server
```
